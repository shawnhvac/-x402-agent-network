# @coinbase/payments-mcp

A TypeScript-based npx installer for the payments-mcp project, providing seamless integration with stdio-compatible MCP clients for  agentic payments via x402 and the x402 Bazaar.

## Quick Start

### 1) Install payments-mcp:

```bash
npx @coinbase/payments-mcp

- **Gemini** - Google Gemini CLI
- **Other** - Other MCP-compatible tools

### 3) Automatic Configuration (Optional):

The installer supports **automatic configuration** for compatible MCP clients.

You'll be prompted during installation, or you can:

```bash
# Automatically configure without prompting
npx @coinbase/payments-mcp --client claude --auto-config

# Skip automatic configuration
npx @coinbase/payments-mcp --client claude --no-auto-config
```

### 4) Manual Configuration (If Needed):

If you skip automatic configuration, detailed setup instructions will be displayed.
